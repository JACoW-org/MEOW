and on opposite edge for B magnet

 Higher demagnetizing fields for A magnets: 18kOe, 
B magnets: 15kOe → different grades for A and B

magnets ~0.7° rms, despite of smaller magnets and 
45° magnetization direction

> Angular error after gluing slightly increased to 1.2°

rms, absolute values of magnetization angle cannot 
be interpreted directly

Magnet – Manufacturing & Characterization

> Fabrication of magnet pairs (specification to vendors)

 Production of both, single A and B magnets from die-pressed TP-material
 Magnet errors: 1% Mr scatter and 1.5° angular errors
 GBD treatment for all single magnets
 Gluing of single magnets to AB-pairs in fully randomized configurations
 Coating of magnet pairs

> Magnetic measurements

 Helmholtz coil measurements of completed AB- and BA-magnet pairs 
 Hall mapper (“camera”) measurements of magnets (possibly)
 Short stretched wire stand for assembled magnet keepers
- direct measurement of field integral errors on-axis
- additionally Hall probe for field amplitude/phase error

> Magnet structure assembly

 Sorting of keepers based on Helmholtz, SW and Hall probe data
 Magnetic measurement and pre-shimming of upper and lower girders 

separately

Test Sorting of Short Prototype Structure

Assembled structure (16 periods) measured with Hall 
probe bench + earth field

Prediction from individual magnet measurements with
stretched wire (background earth field subtracted)

horizontal

vertical

horizontal

Good match, except for ambient field offset and different scan length of bench/wire

Reasonably good agreement except for some global offset due to an imperfect consideration of the ambient field contribution

APPLE-III Field Error Correction
Decomposition of field errors

Two measurements with different shift of one axis.

Difference of two measurements eliminates B234

M1 = B1(x)             + B2(x) + B3(x) + B4(x)
M2 = B1(x + shift) + B2(x) + B3(x) + B4(x)

Test: Field error introduced in row B1

D = M2 - M1 = B1(x+shift) – B1(x)

Looks like derivative: (f(x+dx) – f(x)) / dx, with dx = shift
"integrated" back as: B1[i] = B1[i-shift] + D[i]

Keeper Design
Magnetic Forces on Keepers and Deformation

•

Force Compensation reduces overall net forces on 
rows and quadrants of keepers

• Moments stay relatively high

• All forces and moments vary with shift

• Direction rotates around with shift

• Magnitude stays nearly constant
