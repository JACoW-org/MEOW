# MEOW - README

MEOW (Machine Editor for cOnferences Website) is a collection of tools and scripts to generate
the proceedings from data managed in Indico and stored on PSI or JLab file servers to be
published on JACoW at CERN and KEK.

MEOW can be used pre-conference to generate abstract booklets, during conference
to check on errors in the processed PDFs, and post-conference to generate the proceedings.

The Joint Accelerator Conferences Website (JACoW) is an international collaboration that publishes the proceedings of accelerator conferences held around the world.
